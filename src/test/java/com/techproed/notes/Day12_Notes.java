Q:Where do you use STATIC keyword in your framework?
A: In my Driver Class, our driver is static, so it can be shared across the framework(or so
    driver instance can be used globally in the framework)

What is POM?
    It is a framework design pattern
    We separate page objects and action test cases
    We store page objects in a different classes and we use them in test class
        -We use @FindBy annotation to locate the page object in page class
    PageFactory: It is used in constructor in the pages instantiate the objects
Why POM?
    Reusability
    Easy maintenance
    Readibility
    Time Saver
